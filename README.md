## 🎮 About

**randomizer-cs2** is the ultimate way to spice up your CS2 experience! Ready to add a twist of unpredictability to your
gameplay? 🎲  
**Disclaimer:** This is NOT a cheat! It's a fun tool to mix things up—completely safe and legal to use.

## 🎯 Purpose

This app randomly triggers **custom event clusters** at intervals *(default: every 30-120 seconds, adjustable)*.

These clusters simulate simple button presses like **W-A-S-D, Spacebar**, **Mouse Clicks**, **weapon switching**,
**shooting**, or **moving your mouse**. Think of it as adding controlled chaos to your movement and actions in CS2!
🕹️

💡 *Because it only sends random button inputs without altering the game directly, using randomizer-cs2 is completely
allowed. No risk of bans!* 🚫👮‍♂️
